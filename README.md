# rainbow_pages
The internet has been an enabling tool for LGBTQIA+ people to find one community, shared interests and emotional support. We would like to continue in this tradition by creating a repository of out-and-proud LQBTQIA+ people, organisations and businesses in Cape Town that is searchable online.    The idea is to create a repository, a "Rainbow Pages", where LGBTQIA+ businesses, organisations, communities, artists, professionals, side hustlers, etc. in Cape Town can list their work. Consent here is really important, because of the dangers that people within our community face, so we ask that you have explicit permission from a business, individual or organisation to fill out this form on their behalf. Better yet - share this form with them and let them fill it out themselves.   Our vision is to create a platform where young people can seek out mentors in their fields, where professionals can connect and network, where people can seek out affirming healthcare practitioners, where allies can come to find local businesses to support and where you can see yourself in amongst other queers trying to make it happen for themselves.
